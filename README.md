# MazePath
A simple MazePath solving game made from C# on Windows Form Application

I build this project to learn the AI algorithm called First Depth, which is a stack that stores the paths for moving from a Start position to an end position in a maze.

User can play this game by just click on the boxes, except for the Start(S) and the Goal(G) box. Then, the user will click [Calculate Path] and the AI will find out the route to complete the maze.
